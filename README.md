# AR-Face-Tracking-Android-Interface
Augmented Reality face tracking interface built for Android, powered by Unity. 
Utilized my fundamental C# knowledge at the time. Mainly to add customizability to the interface, through adding a texture toggle button to swap masks.

# Program Overview
- Android Interface built through Unity Game Engine. A research paper is scheduled to be published explaining the progression and capabilties of this project.
- Uses AR foundation plugin to track facial features and create a fully responsive mask on the user's front-facing camera. 
- The interface is customizable by importing PNG textures to unity.
- Masks can be toggled to change the texture/material on the mask surface. 
- The project is ready to be merged with NFT-capabilities to allow artists and designers to add tHeir own textures to the interface.
- Designers can hold a hopyright of the etxutres they add to the interface. As these textures are built specifically for this interface.

# Tools needed to replicate project
- Unity editor 2021.X
- Android Mobile Device with OS version 7.0+ and AR comptatibility. Check -> https://developers.google.com/ar/devices

**Notes:**
- Need to install AR founcation and ARCore, if working with Android. Else, replace ARCore with ARKit for IOS development.
- This project was only tested on Android (Google Pixel 7, in my case)
